Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

var summation = function (num) {
  // Code here
  let sum = 0
  for (let i=0; i <= num; i++)
    sum += i
  return sum;
}





You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.
Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20
Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

function positiveSum(arr) {
    let sum = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if(arr[i] > 0) sum += arr[i]
    }
    return sum
}

OR

const positiveSum = arr => arr.reduce((accumulator, current) => current > 0 ? accumulator + current : accumulator, 0);

OR

const positiveSum = arr => arr.filter(number => number > 0).reduce((accumulator, current) => accumulator + current, 0)
