Task
Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).
The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value
Mind the input validation.


function sumArray(array) {
    return array.length < 2 ? 0 : array.reduce((a, b) => a + b) - Math.min(...array) - Math.max(...array);
}
console.log(
    sumArray([6, 2, 1, 8, 10])
)  


#steps
 The code is calculating the sum of an array.
 The code starts by checking if the length of the array is less than 2, and if it is then it returns 0.
 If not, then it calculates the sum of all elements in the array minus Math.min(...array) and plus Math.max(...array).
 The code will return the sum of all numbers in the array.
